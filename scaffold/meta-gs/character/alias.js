 * Character alias table (scaffold, minimal).

 * Why keep it small:
 * - This file belongs to metaGenerator scaffold (runtime skeleton).
 * - Large, hand-maintained alias lists are redundant and become stale quickly.
 * - Prefer generating aliases from upstream data (or LLM) during `meta-gen gen` if needed.
